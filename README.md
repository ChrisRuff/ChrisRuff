## I have experience in many different projects ##

## What are my interests? ##
* I love the speed and control C++ provides programming. The level of control that one can have over the program to ensure proper usage is my bread and butter
  * `[[nodiscard]] int keepReturnResult(int);`
  * `class Ex { int a{1}; int doesntChangeState() const { return a; } };` 
  * std::unique_ptr<int> p{new int}; // Only use these when neccessary
* Another one of my interest is machine learning and I have quite a bit of experience using python to create neural networks.
